Hello! My name is Jibril Frej, I am a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL's Machine Learning for Education ([ML4ED](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ml4ed/)) lab. My current research focuses on developing Explainable Course **Recommendation Systems**, using **Knowledge Graphs**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Language Models**.

<span style="font-size: 18px;">
Before joining EPFL, I completed my PhD at the University of Grenoble, working within the [MRIM](http://lig-mrim.imag.fr/lig-mrim.imag.fr/index.html) and [GETALP](https://lig-getalp.imag.fr/) labs. My doctoral research centered on applying **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing** to **Information Retrieval**.

Beyond education, I am enthusiastic about applied **Machine Learning**. I’ve worked on a variety of projects involving **Image Processing**, **Text**, and **Knowledge Graphs**. From industrial applications to academic research, I enjoy tackling complex problems using Machine Learning.

<span style="font-size: 18px;">
I began my journey into Machine Learning during an R&D internship at Altatech sc (now [UNITY sc](https://unity-sc.com/)), where I developed a machine learning-based solution for **silicon wafer defect characterization**. Since then, I’ve grown increasingly passionate about coding and applying machine learning techniques, especially deep learning. I am also dedicated to **teaching** and enjoy explaining AI and mathematical concepts to diverse audiences, both specialists and non-specialists.
